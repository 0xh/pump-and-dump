A pump and dump application for cryptocurrencies using [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)

Setup generated with [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)

## [Releases](https://github.com/gobeli/pump-and-dump/releases) ##

## Tips
 - Some exchanges have timeouts / request limits, to prevent them adjust the polling timeout via the textbox so stuff doesn't break ;)
 - I have only tested some exchanges, which means I can't guarantee that it will work on every exchange [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) provides. If yours does not work open an Issue or even better a PR with a fix.
